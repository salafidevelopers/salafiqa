    question:
      "What is the ruling on a person who stretches out his feet in the direction of the Qiblah (Ka'bah-direction faced in Prayer) in a Masjid (mosque)? Also, is it permissible to eat and sleep in a Masjid?",
    answer:
      "There is no harm if a Muslim stretches out his feet in the direction of the Qiblah whether in a Masjid or any other place. Likewise, there is no harm to eat or sleep in a Masjid when necessary but the Masjid should be kept clean. However, if a Muslim experiences a wet dream while sleeping inside a Masjid, he should leave it to perform Ghusl (ritual bath following major ritual impurity).There is no harm if a Muslim stretches out his feet in the direction of the Qiblah whether in a Masjid or any other place.
