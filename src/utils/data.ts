    question:
      "What is the ruling on a person who stretches out his feet in the direction of the Qiblah (Ka'bah-direction faced in Prayer) in a Masjid (mosque)? Also, is it permissible to eat and sleep in a Masjid?",
    answer:
      "There is no harm if a Muslim stretches out his feet in the direction of the Qiblah whether in a Masjid or any other place. Likewise, there is no harm to eat or sleep in a Masjid when necessary but the Masjid should be kept clean. However, if a Muslim experiences a wet dream while sleeping inside a Masjid, he should leave it to perform Ghusl (ritual bath following major ritual impurity).There is no harm if a Muslim stretches out his feet in the direction of the Qiblah whether in a Masjid or any other place.

      "Rebuking Others For Praying More Than 11 Rak’ahs [Shaykh ‘Arafat bin Hassan al-Muhammadi]",
    questionNo: "# 795",
    publishedOn: "April 2, 2024",
    question:
      "There are some people who rebuke others sternly for praying more than 11 rak’ahs of Night Prayer, or Taraaweeh. What is your opinion about that?",
    answer:
      "This is wrong. This is a mistake. If you were to refer back to the books of the Salaf, and the books of Fiqh (Jurisprudence) in general, the later ones and the earlier ones, you would find that the jurists in this issue differed about the number of rak’ahs, but only about what number was best. Some said that the Sunnah for Taraaweeh is that we pray 36 rak’ahs. This is widespread and well known to be from al-Imaam Maalik. Refer to al-Mudawwanah. If you were to read from the rest of the math-habs as well, you will find that they said specifically: 20 rak’ahs. They said that the Sunnah for Taraaweeh is that we pray 20 rak’ahs. This is the math-hab of the majority: the Hanafees, the Shaafi’ees, and the Hanbalees. You do not find a single one of the early scholars saying that it is not allowed to pray more than 11 rak’ahs. Never.",

      "Keen Scholarly Insight of Shaykh Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee (may Allah preserve him) About the Causes of Differing During Crises and Emergencies",
    questionNo: "# 395",
    publishedOn: "December 10, 2023",
    question:
      "We are here together, and to Allah is all praise, gathered and talking to one another [cordially], without any differing between us. Yet, I see that when some of us return to their lands, they begin differing, even warning against each other. This happens even though they are all Salafees, their reference points are the same, and they all honor the same scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah in this land. So what is your advice to them, may Allah reward you with goodness?",
    answer:
      "I always advise my brothers and my children among the students of knowledge to stay away from whatever causes differing. This means that sticking to the texts [of revelation] is an absolutely necessary matter; it is a must. Yet, there are ijtihaadaat (attempts to assess and derive rulings on issues) which lead to division. Some ijtihaadaat are beneficial; Allah provides benefit through them to Islam and the Muslims. For this reason, the door of ijtihaad remains open, open to provide benefit to the Ummah, to guide them, to derive rulings from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace. The one who tries to shut the door of ijtihaad is mistaken, and he has no evidence. However, firstly, no one is to perform ijtihaad other than one suitable for it, one who has equipped himself with the sciences of the Book, the Sunnah, the [Arabic] Language, and other things. This is the one who performs ijtihaad and investigates relative matters when nawaazil (crucial matters in need of important rulings) take place. As for students of knowledge, one of them tries to understand as much as he can from the textual evidence. However, in current events and crises, no one is to speak other than the elite Continue reading →",

    question:
      "If I came for Hajj in the company of a group of ladies, without any mahram (male family member) of mine, while I am more than 50 years old, is my Hajj considered correct?",
    answer:
      "It is not permissible for a Muslim lady to perform Hajj without a mahram (male family member). The Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) said, “No woman may travel without a mahram accompanying her.” Some of the scholars held that it is permissible to perform Hajj in a group of trustworthy women without any mahram, yet Continue reading →",

      "A Simple Guide to Dignified Recovery After Religious Neglect [Shaykh Ibn Baaz]",
    questionNo: "# 295",
    publishedOn: "February 3, 2023",
    question:
      "An amazing and insightful letter from a great imaam, the mufti and scholar, Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have Mercy on him), to an individual who complained of weakness in faith and expressed remorse over abandoning prayers for a time and other serious forms of religious neglect. His answer is highly beneficial and motivating for all of our brothers and sisters who face similar situations; it addresses and corrects a common misunderstanding – that after abandoning the religion, or falling into severe levels of neglect, the process of returning is embarrassing, or extremely difficult, involving making up many prayers, or maybe even unattainable, assuming that someone cannot return because Allah does not guide the one who has repeatedly fallen into neglect and abandonment of his religion… From ‘Abdul-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abdillaah ibn Baaz to the respected Mr. [*****] (name removed), may Allah grant him refuge from the devil’s whisperings and give him success in setting aright both his religious and worldly affairs. To proceed: Your letter reached me, the one in which you explained some things you did and some problems you were facing, fearing their bad consequences. And we did invite you on 1390/7/13 to come visit in person, but that was not easy for you. So at this time we will respond, in shaa’ Allah (if Allah so wills), to the content of your letter: Firstly, you mentioned that you pray sometimes, and sometimes you do not pray. You become determined to repent sometimes, but then you do not fulfill that. Sometimes, this laxness may have led you into abandonment of all the pillars [of Islam], and you have become determined to genuinely repent and put a complete end to those things, yet will your repentance be accepted [you ask]? Or will you be from those whom Allah has described as: “Verily those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe, then disbelieve, and then are increased in disbelief, Allah does not forgive them,” to the end of that Verse [4:137]? And is it required as part of the repentance that you openly declare your testimony of faith for all to hear? And is it a must to take a bath and pray two units of prayer, etc.? The answer: Verily, Allah has clarified in His great Book that He, the Exalted One, accepts the repentance of His worshippers no matter how various and numerous their sins are! As Allah, the Lofty, has said [what means]: Continue reading →",
