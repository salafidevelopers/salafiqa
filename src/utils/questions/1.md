# Rebuking Others For Praying More Than 11 Rak’ahs [Shaykh Arafat bin Hassan al-Muhammadi]

    *In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Ever Merciful…*

The following question was posed to **Shaykh Arafat bin Hassan al-Muhammadi** (may Allah preserve him):

> There are some people who rebuke others sternly for
> praying more than 11 rak’ahs of Night Prayer, or Taraaweeh. What is your
> opinion about that?

He replied:

This is wrong. This is a mistake. If you were to refer back to the books of the Salaf, and the books of _Fiqh_
(Jurisprudence) in general, the later ones and the earlier ones, you
would find that the jurists in this issue differed about the number of _rak’ahs_ , but only about what number was best. [1]

Some said that the Sunnah for _Taraaweeh_ is that we pray 36 _rak’ahs_ . This is widespread and well known to be from al-Imaam Maalik. Refer to _al-Mudawwanah._ [2]

If you were to read from the rest of the math-habs as well, you will find that they said specifically: 20 _rak’ahs_ . They said that the Sunnah for _Taraaweeh_ is that we pray 20 _rak’ahs_ . This is the _math-hab_ of the majority: the Hanafees, the Shaafi’ees, and the Hanbalees.

You do not find a single one of the early scholars saying that it is not allowed to pray more than 11 _rak’ahs_ . Never. [3] So do not be hasty in these kinds of issues.

When there is a scholar who erred in that [issue], or attempted _ijtihaad_ (forming his own opinion based on consideration of the evidence), it is to be said: He attempted _ijtihaad_ , and he deserves reward for that.

It is well known that **al-Imaam al-Albaanee** (may Allah have Mercy on him, and may Allah forgive him) is one of those who attempted _ijtihaad_ in this issue, yet he erred. And all of the scholars of his time considered him erroneous, like **Shaykh Ibn Baaz, Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen,** [4] and our teacher, **Shaykh Rabee’** , and a number of other shaykhs. It is not to be said that this (i.e. praying more than 11) is _bid’ah_ (innovation); it is not to be said this is not permissible. Rather, what can be said is: Pray 11 _rak’ahs_ ; that might be best. Or pray 20, or pray 36.

And what is their evidence for these increased numbers [larger than
11]? A number of hadeeth narrations. One of those narrations is the
action of ‘Umar. It is authentically established that he prayed 20 _rak’ahs_ ,
as found in a number of reports from different routes of transmission
back to ‘Umar. These are collected by Ibn al-Ja’d in his _Musnad_ and al-Bayhaqee in his _Sunan_ . And a group of qualified scholars authenticated them.

They also used evidence from a number of _marfoo’_ hadeeth narrations (i.e. from the Prophet, may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace):

**“Prayer in the night is _mathnaa-mathnaa_
(two-by-two); when one of you fears the arrival of the morning (i.e. the
entrance of Fajr time), then let him make one rak’ah of Witr.” ** [5]

**“_Mathnaa-mathnaa_ (two-by-two),”** and then he said, **“Let him make one _rak’ah_ of Witr.”**

And there is a third position in the issue as well, which is that the number of _rak’ahs_ for _Taraaweeh_ , including the _Witr_ , is 11 _rak’ahs_ ,
as a preference only, not that it is required. You will not find any
scholar saying that is required, as I have already said to you.

So it is said (based on this third position), that 11 _rak’ahs_ is what is best, since it was the action of the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace).

Or: 20 _rak’ahs_ is best, since it was the action of ‘Umar and a group [of scholars] considered that _marfoo’_ from the Messenger of Allah.

Or: al-Imam Maalik said that it is 36 _rak’ahs_ .

Then, along came **Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah** (may
Allah have Mercy on him), and he took a unique stance on this topic. And
no doubt, it is a position that indicates his understanding and
knowledge (may Allah have Mercy on him). What is it that Shaykh al-Islam
Ibn Taymiyah said about this issue?

Shaykh al-Islam said: If you are going to pray just like the Prophet
(may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace), praying a long prayer as
he did, when he used to pray 11 _rak’ahs_ , yet he would recite for a long time, and he would remain bowing and prostrating for a long time, then pray 11 _rak’ahs_ [like this]. But if you are not able to pray this long, then pray more _rak’ahs_ . Pray more _rak’ahs_ ,
since you are shortening the length of your standing, bowing, and
prostration. Shaykh al-Islam used to state specifically that _Taraaweeh_ Prayer has no specific legislated number [of *rak’ahs* ]. He would say that if you are going to pray a smaller number of _rak’ahs_ , then what is legislated for you is to lengthen the standing. And if you are going to pray a larger number of _rak’ahs_ , then, here in this case, shorten your time standing. This gathers all the texts [on the topic] together harmoniously. [6]

**So we say to those brothers:** In these kinds of
issues, it is wrong for you to differ and accuse one another [of
things], rebuking one another sternly. What is needed is that you learn,
and that you calm down in these types of issues and not cause
calamities.

Along with this, these people might be among our Salafi brothers. So
we do not treat them as they treat us, going to them and rebuking them
sternly, warning against them, causing calamities and disturbances. This
is wrong. They are to be advised with gentleness. And no doubt, sitting
together for mutual research in these issues yields good results and
benefit.

[3] **From the translator:** Scholarly consensus ( _ijmaa’_ ) has been cited by al-Haafith Ibn ‘Abdil-Barr in his _Tamheed_ ([13/214](https://www.bakkah.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-03-29-091021.png); [21/69-70](https://www.bakkah.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-03-29-091306.png)),
and there is no known predecessor for the position that that 11 or 13
is a legislated limit. The only differing that seems to exist was in
preference, while no one claimed there was an actual specified number as
a legislated limit, one impermissible to surpass.

If you feel this citation of _ijmaa_ ‘ is not actually valid
historically, please cite your reference for a different position held
among the early scholars (meaning: Someone who stated that there
actually **IS** a legislated limit for the number of _rak’ahs_ in Night Prayers) in the replies, and may Allah reward you. **Such a contribution will be considered highly valuable and much appreciated.**

**UPDATE:** Some relevant words of **al-Imam Ibn Khuzaymah** (d.311) were brought to my attention after the publication of this article, as found in his _Saheeh_ (1/577-578):

فكل من أخبر من أصحاب النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، أو من أزواجه أو غيرهن
من النساء أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم صلى من الليل عددا من الصلاة، أو
صلى بصفة فقد صلى النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم تلك الصلاة في بعض الليالي بذلك
العدد وبتلك الصفة، وهذا الاختلاف من جنس المباح، فجائز للمرء أن يصلي أي
عدد أحب من الصلاة مما روي عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم أنه صلاهن، وعلى
الصفة التي رويت عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم أنه صلاها، لا حظر على أحد في
شيء منها.

**Summarized:** After compiling authentic reports about the Prophet’s night prayers (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) being **13 rak’ahs, 11 rak’ahs, and nine** ,
al-Imam Ibn Khuzaymah (may Allah have Mercy on him) stated that it is
permissible to pray any of those varieties which have come from the
Messenger of Allah (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace).
Shaykh al-Albaanee infers from these words that he meant (but **did not** state) that it is then **not permissible**
to pray more than these numbers. This conclusion is the actual position
which the scholars did not accept from Shaykh al-Albaanee (may Allah
have Mercy on him), of course after reading his detailed arguments on
the topic. Quite simply, this is the unique understanding of Shaykh
al-Albaanee about what **could be understood** form the words of al-Imam Ibn Khuzaymah, not actually the words of Ibn Khuzaymah himself, so please **note the difference** .
In an issue of cited scholarly consensus, one can see why the
conclusion of this scholar (Shaykh al-Albaanee), as highly ranking as he
was, would be met with skepticism. And Allah knows best.
